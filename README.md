# Financial Golf
Welcome to Financial Golf, a secure educational app combining money management tools, quizzes, and a hidden easter egg game safely enclosed in a Rust desktop sandbox.

## How To Build Your App (Zero-Toolchain Setup)
Since you prefer not to install any developer tools (like Rust or Go) on your Windows machine, this project relies on **GitHub Actions**.

1. **Create a GitHub Account**: Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up if you haven't.
2. **Create a Repository**: Create a new empty repository named `Financial Golf` (Public or Private is fine).
3. **Upload the Code**: 
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in this folder (`C:\Users\System Admin Hacker\Desktop\Financial Golf`).
   - Run these commands:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git branch -M main
     git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - (Alternatively, you can drag and drop these folders via the GitHub website or use GitHub Desktop).
4. **Download Your `.exe`**: 
   - Once uploaded, GitHub runs the builder cloud automatically!
   - Wait about 5-10 minutes.
   - Go to your repository's "Releases" section.
   - Download the `Financial Golf.exe` file under Assets and play!
